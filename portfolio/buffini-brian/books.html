              <h2>Takin' Care of&nbsp;Business</h2>
              <p>In &quot;Takin’ Care of Business: The BIG IDEA for Small Business,&quot; you’ll learn the one critical element that determines success or failure for a small business. In addition to strategies and tactics to help you succeed, this book features inspirational stories of ordinary, everyday folks who’ve turned their businesses around and are now enjoying the good life.</p>
              <p>Business experts Brian Buffini and Joe Niego realized that even though small businesses are at the heart of our economy, there isn’t much hands-on training out there for the person who was brave enough to bet on them self and open a business. They both know how quickly you can find yourself adrift, facing challenges you couldn’t have foreseen.</p>

              <h2>Oh, by the way&hellip;</h2>
              <p>It’s a long way from the streets of Dublin to Carlsbad, California, and I’d like to relate my joyful journey to you in these pages. I started out as a housepainter’s son, came to America, and became a realtor®. After much trial and error, I developed a wonderful system for doing business. It made my business a success and changed my life for the better. Then, one day, my bride Beverly changed my life even more dramatically. “The system has improved our lives so much and we meet so many people who are struggling,” she said to me, “that you need to go out and share it with others.” Now, it’s not usually a good thing when your wife tells you to hit the road, but in this instance it turned out to be providential.</p>

              <p>You don't have to be in real estate or lending a long time to realize that your business and life are interconnected. Naturally, your business can have a positive impact on your personal life, such as offering the potential to earn a significant income and the ability to work flexible hours. But our business also tends to be all-consuming, which can quickly rob agents and lenders of any life outside of&nbsp;work.</p>
              <p>Each circle in the Buffini &amp; Company logo represents one of the five major areas of a person's life: Spiritual, Family, Business, Financial and Personal (Physical and Emotional). The circles are joined to show that one area of life affects all the others. Buffini &amp; Company is excited to share with you the Working by Referral system, which takes a holistic approach to operating your business so that all five circles in your life remain linked in harmony.</p>
